##### ME

- 🌙 I know, I should have started to develop my GitHub sooner;
- 😫 Tired of working with WordPress;
- 🚀 Improving my skills on `TypeScript`, `React.js`, `Next.js`, `Tailwind CSS`, `GraphQL` and `Node.js`;
- 🔍 Looking for a challenging and exciting remote job;
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I'm a very competitive player;
